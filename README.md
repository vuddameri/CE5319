# Course Purpose

The purpose of this early graduate level class is to provide students with broad introduction to the theory and practice of machine learning (ML) and illustrate how ML concepts and algorithms can be applied to solve civil engineering problems.  Students will be exposed to many civil engineering datasets and the versatile R and Python programming languages.

# Course Objectives

The availability of big data is transforming Civil Engineering profession.  Data-driven tools and algorithms have the potential to model highly nonlinear civil engineering phenomena and extract information that is not possible through traditional modeling methods.  Machine learning is a fast-growing field and its use in civil engineering will become standard in the next few years.  The primary objective of this course is to provide necessary theoretical basis and exposure to ML applications in Civil Engineering.
